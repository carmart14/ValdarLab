## Main Goal

-Run a genome scan for all the loci within a chromosome without the h2lmm scan function.

-allRNA has all the haplotypes and the expression data that has been cleaned and normalized

### 9/11/24 - Meeting with Teresa Project and Goals

Got the miqtl function to work so I have a reference of what the actual general output of what I'm doing is going to look like. Meeting with WV in 2 days to talk more about the project and what steps I should be at for the next week. -Personal goal; have a understanding of what the genome scan is and how it's working. -Get a manual version working and plotted -Write a loop to iterate over the mutliple loci

Reasons the pvalues are different than the miQTL: the model ran in the manual mode is using lm while miQTL is most likley using an extreme value distribution. This is going to be a more accurate way to account for p values because the distribution of the data will be modeled more accurately
